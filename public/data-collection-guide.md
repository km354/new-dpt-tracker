# DPT Program Data Collection Guide

## Best Legal Approaches to Collect DPT Program Data

### 1. **PTCAS Directory (Most Comprehensive)**
**URL:** https://ptcasdirectory.apta.org/

**Method:**
- Visit each program's page
- Copy the following information:
  - School name
  - Location (City, State)
  - Website URL
  - DPT Program URL (direct link to admissions/requirements page)
  - Prerequisites (subject, min grade, credits required)
  - Application fee
  - Deadline information

**Time Estimate:** ~5-10 minutes per school

### 2. **CAPTE Directory**
**URL:** https://www.capteonline.org/

**Method:**
- Use to verify accredited programs
- Get official contact information
- Cross-reference with PTCAS data

### 3. **Third-Party Spreadsheets (Fastest)**
Some pre-made spreadsheets exist:
- Search for "PTCAS Program Spreadsheet" 
- These are often compiled by students/alumni
- **Verify accuracy** before importing
- May need formatting adjustments for our import

### 4. **Browser Extensions/Tools (Time Savers)**

**Option A: Manual Browser Extension**
- Use a browser extension to help copy data
- Or use browser bookmarks to organize research

**Option B: Excel/Google Sheets**
- Create a spreadsheet with columns matching our format
- Research multiple schools at once
- Convert to JSON when ready to import

### 5. **Data Collection Template**

Use this structure when collecting:

```
School Name: [Name]
Location: [City, State]
Website: [https://...]
DPT Program URL: [https://.../dpt-program]
Application Fee: $[amount]
Deadline: [date]

Prerequisites:
1. [Subject] - Min Grade: [grade] - Credits: [number]
2. [Subject] - Min Grade: [grade] - Credits: [number]
...
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. **Start with PTCAS Directory**
   - Filter by location/state if needed
   - Go through programs systematically
   - Use browser tabs to keep multiple programs open

2. **Use Spreadsheet for Collection**
   - Create a Google Sheet/Excel with our format
   - Fill in data as you research
   - This makes it easier to review and edit

3. **Convert to JSON**
   - Use our template format
   - Or use a spreadsheet-to-JSON converter
   - Import via bulk import feature

4. **Verify Critical Data**
   - Double-check prerequisites
   - Verify URLs work
   - Confirm deadlines are current

## Tips for Efficiency

- **Batch Research:** Spend 1-2 hours collecting data for 10-15 schools
- **Focus on Your Target Schools:** Start with schools you're actually interested in
- **Update Regularly:** Program requirements change, verify annually
- **Use Search Filters:** PTCAS lets you filter by state, which helps organize research
